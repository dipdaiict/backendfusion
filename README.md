# BackendFusion: FastAPI Production-Style Backend (Learning Project)

## 📚 Overview

This is a **learning project** aimed at simulating a **production-level backend system** using modern DevOps and backend practices. Built around **FastAPI**, it integrates observability, security, CI/CD, caching, and containerization — providing hands-on experience with tools used in real-world deployments.

While this project is not meant for production use, it serves as a robust reference for understanding how scalable and secure backend systems are architected and maintained.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### 🖥️ Backend Framework
- **FastAPI** – High-performance async Python web framework

### 🗄️ Database
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM layer
- **Alembic** – Database migrations

### 🚀 CI/CD & Containerization
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **Jenkins** – Automated CI/CD pipeline

### ☁️ Cloud & Deployment
- **AWS EC2** – Basic cloud hosting
- **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)** – Scalable container orchestration
  - Exploring **Helm** for Kubernetes package management

### 📦 Caching
- **Redis** – In-memory caching layer

### 🛡️ Security & API Best Practices
- **JWT / OAuth2** – Authentication and role-based access
- **Rate Limiting** – Using `slowapi` or `fastapi-limiter` + Redis
- **CORS**, **HTTPS**, and secure headers (helmet-style)

### 📈 Observability
- **OpenTelemetry** – Distributed tracing
- **Jaeger** – Traces visualization and debugging

### 📊 Code Quality
- **SonarQube** – Static code analysis and maintainability

### 📖 API Documentation
- **Swagger UI** & **ReDoc** – Auto-generated via FastAPI
